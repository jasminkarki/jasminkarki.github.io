I'm thrilled to share a significant milestone in my academic journey! After much dedication and careful consideration, I have finalized my Master's Thesis Project and secured an exceptional guide <a href="www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ayon/#">Prof. Ayon Chakraborty</a> to mentor me along the way.

The focus of my thesis will revolve around the captivating domain of Smart Sensing for IoT systems. Specifically, I will be exploring on video compression through the ingenious use of wireless signals. Starting tomorrow, I will embark on this thrilling research endeavor, eager to expand my knowledge and make valuable contributions to this cutting-edge field. This opportunity fills me with excitement, and I'm looking forward to the challenges and discoveries that lie ahead.
