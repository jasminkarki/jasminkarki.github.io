Chennai, Tamil Nadu


I am currently studing Masters in Technology with specialization in Cyber Physical Systems(CPS) at IIT Madras (CGPA: 8.59/10)

I completed by Bachelors in Computer Engineering from Kathmandu University (CGPA: 3.58/4)

After undergraduate, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer in Fusemachines for two years before joining IIT Madras.

During my time at Fuesmachines, I worked in building NLP/ML based systems(topic extraction and report generation, conversational survey platform, chatbots) using cutting edge tools and technologies. 

I also created interactive contents for non-technical professionals and high-school students to begin their career in AI. The course was first offered to high school students of QI Roberts Jr.-Sr. High School along with other students in rural and underserved America.
