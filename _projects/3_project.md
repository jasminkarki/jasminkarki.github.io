Abstract — The information age has created several outlets to pave the pathway for public opinion and citizen journalism. With an exponential number of contents being created on a daily basis, a significant part of it includes fake content, or so-called “fake news”, usually created with malicious intent. Such an alarming growth of fake news, malicious lies, ineffectiveness of fact-checking and resilience of populist propaganda, demands a system that classifies it to prevent public deceiving and maintain ethical journalism. A promising solution that has come up recently is to use machine learning algorithms to detect patterns in the circulated news that will aid in filtering out the fake content. On this note, we have developed a classification model using the lexical and semantic features extracted from news articles and its sources. Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and k-NN models were used and the results were compared to determine the best one among them. Based on precision, recall and f1 score, k-NN and Logistic Regression gave the most promising results. This is quite inspiring and significant to what was previously developed with similar techniques. Keywords: Fake News, Machine Learning, NLP, Word Embeddings
